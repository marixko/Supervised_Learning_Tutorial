# Supervised Learning - Tutorial for Astronomers

###**STAR/GALAXY separation**#

In this tutorial we will perform a STAR/GALAXY separation using a real dataset from [S-PLUS](http://www.splus.iag.usp.br/). This data were already matched with [SDSS](https://www.sdss.org/) (DR15) spectroscopical data and it will be used to train and test the supervised classifiers. The final step (not included in this tutorial) is to use the trained model to predict the classification of your unknown objects.
 
 This tutorial will be entirely in Python 3 and we will go through the following topics:
- Introduction to `Pandas`
- Data visualization with `seaborn`
- Classification methods with `sklearn`

Have fun!
